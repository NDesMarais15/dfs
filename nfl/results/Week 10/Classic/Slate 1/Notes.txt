- I swapped the Washington defense for the Saints defense in lineup 14 because Stafford was playing
against Washington and I haven't gotten a chance to write the constraint for this in the code (i.e.
no QB against the defense he is actually playing). The Saints were the highest projected given the
salary constraint that was left. I think they were not picked because of the lineup constraint.

- The lineup overlap I used was 2 and the number of lineups generated was 20. I did this because
the max for dime contests is 20 lineups, and I wanted to diversify the lineups in order to maximize
my chances of having a lineup get into the top ranks. This may also result in many of the lineups
doing poorly. Even when I had a lineup overlap of 4, almost every lineup was selecting Josh Allen,
and since QB is such an important player on the roster, I felt that having so much uniformity in that
position would make my portfolio too risky.
