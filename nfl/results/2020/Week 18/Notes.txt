- For classic slate 1 (6 teams), I used 2R+1OppR+NoRB&RB+NoPlayervsDef with overlap of 5
- For classic slate 2 (4 teams), I used 2R+1OppR+NoRB&RB+NoQBvsDef with overlap of 6
- For showdown slate 3, I used 2R+1OppR+NoRB&RB+NoQBvsDef with overlap of 5
- With both the second classic slate and the showdown slate, I started by using overlaps of 5 and 4,
respectively. The algorithm then complained that the problem formulation is infeasible. This is
surprising because there are always many players in the available field that aren't very good that
you would think the algorithm could use to continue making new lineups, even if these lineups would
be bad. This leads me to believe there might be something wrong with the algorithm as it stands currently.
This requires some further investigation.
