# DraftKings-NFL

New project to try to win DraftKings NFL contests. 
Right now, I am trying to use a basic QB-WR stacking
strategy to win contests. This is based on results
from the paper "How To Play Fantasy Sports Strategically (and Win)",
where they used this as their benchmark portfolio to test their
strategies against.
