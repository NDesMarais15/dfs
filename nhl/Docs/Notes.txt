- If you take the data from Daily Fantasy Fuel, which is my current plan, you need to clear out
the defender's line values. Otherwise, the algorithm will include defensive players in the line,
which would defeat the purpose of the stacking.
- In the paper, they use projections from Rotogrinders and Daily Fantasy Nerd. These are both paid
services. Instead, I am using Daily Fantasy Fuel because their projections are free. However, it would
be better to check in the future whether these projections are actually good. I'm just assuming they
are decent enough for now.
